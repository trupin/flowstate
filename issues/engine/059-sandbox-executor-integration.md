# [ENGINE-059] Integrate sandbox into executor task lifecycle

## Domain
engine

## Status
todo

## Priority
P0 (critical path)

## Dependencies
- Depends on: DSL-008, ENGINE-058
- Blocks: —

## Spec References
- specs.md Section 3.3 — "Flow Declaration" (sandbox behavior description)

## Summary
Wire the `SandboxManager` into the executor's task lifecycle. When a task's resolved sandbox setting is true, the executor creates a sandboxed AcpHarness with a wrapped command, registers the sandbox for tracking, and ensures cleanup in the finally block. On flow cancellation, all active sandboxes are destroyed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Executor resolves sandbox: `node.sandbox if node.sandbox is not None else flow.sandbox`
- [ ] Executor resolves sandbox_policy: `node.sandbox_policy or flow.sandbox_policy`
- [ ] When sandbox enabled: harness command is wrapped with openshell via SandboxManager
- [ ] A new AcpHarness instance is created with the wrapped command (not mutating the shared one)
- [ ] Sandbox is registered before task execution starts
- [ ] Sandbox is destroyed in the finally block after task completes (success or failure)
- [ ] `cancel()` calls `destroy_all()` to clean up all active sandboxes
- [ ] When sandbox disabled: execution unchanged (no regression)
- [ ] AcpHarness exposes `command` and `env` as readable properties

## Technical Design

### Files to Create/Modify
- `src/flowstate/engine/executor.py` — sandbox resolution and lifecycle in `_execute_single_task`
- `src/flowstate/engine/acp_client.py` — add `command` and `env` properties
- `tests/engine/test_executor.py` — integration tests

### Key Implementation Details

**`executor.py` — `__init__`:**
```python
from flowstate.engine.sandbox import SandboxManager
self._sandbox_mgr = SandboxManager()
```

**`executor.py` — `_execute_single_task` (after harness resolution around line 2359):**
```python
# Resolve sandbox settings (same override pattern as harness)
use_sandbox = node.sandbox if node.sandbox is not None else flow.sandbox
sandbox_policy = node.sandbox_policy or flow.sandbox_policy

if use_sandbox:
    await self._sandbox_mgr.register(task_execution_id)
    wrapped_cmd = self._sandbox_mgr.wrap_command(
        harness.command, task_execution_id, sandbox_policy
    )
    harness = AcpHarness(command=wrapped_cmd, env=harness.env)
```

**`executor.py` — finally block (around line 2595):**
```python
if use_sandbox:
    await self._sandbox_mgr.destroy(task_execution_id)
```

**`executor.py` — `cancel()`:**
```python
await self._sandbox_mgr.destroy_all()
```

**`acp_client.py` — properties:**
```python
@property
def command(self) -> list[str]:
    return list(self._command)

@property
def env(self) -> dict[str, str] | None:
    return dict(self._env) if self._env else None
```

### Edge Cases
- Node has `sandbox = false` overriding flow's `sandbox = true` → no sandbox for that task
- Node has `sandbox_policy` but inherits `sandbox = true` from flow → sandboxed with node policy
- Sandbox creation fails (openshell not running) → AcpHarness will fail to spawn, error propagates normally
- Task cancelled while sandbox is active → `cancel()` → `destroy_all()` cleans up
- Multiple concurrent tasks with sandboxes → each has unique sandbox name from task_execution_id

## Testing Strategy
- Mock-based tests in `tests/engine/test_executor.py`:
  - `test_sandbox_enabled_wraps_command` — verify wrapped harness used
  - `test_sandbox_disabled_no_wrapping` — verify default path unchanged
  - `test_sandbox_node_override_false` — flow=true, node=false → no sandbox
  - `test_sandbox_node_override_policy` — node policy overrides flow policy
  - `test_sandbox_cleanup_on_success` — destroy called after successful task
  - `test_sandbox_cleanup_on_failure` — destroy called after failed task
  - `test_sandbox_cancel_destroys_all` — destroy_all called on cancel

## E2E Verification Plan

### Verification Steps
1. Create a `.flow` file with `sandbox = true`
2. Start the server: `uv run flowstate serve`
3. Start a flow run via the API
4. If openshell is installed and Docker running: verify sandbox appears in `openshell sandbox list` during execution, and is cleaned up after
5. If openshell not installed: verify clear error message about missing openshell
